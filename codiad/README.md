# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

  * [`latest` (Dockerfile)](https://github.com/wernight/docker-codiad/blob/master/Dockerfile) [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/wernight/codiad.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/wernight/codiad "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com")
  * [`alpine` (Dockerfile)](https://github.com/wernight/docker-codiad/blob/alpine/Dockerfile) [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/wernight/codiad:alpine.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/wernight/codiad "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com")
  * `2`, `2.7`, `2.7.4` (and similar versionned tags) are like `latest` but for a specific version of Codiad.


## What is Codiad

[**Codiad**](http://codiad.com/) is a web-based IDE framework with a small footprint and minimal requirements.

You can add [many plugins](http://market.codiad.com/) from the Web UI by opening the right side bar and clicking Marketplace.


### Features of this image

  * **Simple or Lean**:
      * `latest` is based on Ubuntu, contains `docker` and `docker-compose` binaries, and is easy to extend so as to include required development tools.
      * `alpine` is base on Linux Alpine (very small) with S6 supervisor (lightweight) but *some features may not work* and it does not support custom `CODIAD_UID`/`CODIAD_GID`.
  * **Performant**: Using Nginx + PHP-FPM (very performant).
  * **Secure**:
      * Runs as non-root (Nginx run as `nginx` and PHP-FPM run as UID `2743` by default once started).
      * Includes a brute-force attack protection.



## How to use this image

    docker run --rm -p 8080:80 \
        -e CODIAD_UID=$UID -e CODIAD_GID=$GID \
        -v $PWD/code:/code \
        -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
        wernight/codiad

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

**Parameters:**

  * `-p 80` ‒ the port to expose.
  * `-e CODIAD_UID` and `-e CODIAD_GID` ‒ *(optional)* sets the user / group ID to use for PHP
    (i.e. it'll be the user / group under which all Codiad users will execute commands if they use the Terminal plugin or such).
  * `-v /code` ‒ *(optional)* persists your configuration and installed plugins (you may also use a Docker volume).
  * `-v /etc/localtime` ‒ *(optional)* used for timesync.
  * `-v /var/run/docker.sock` ‒ *(optional)* allows to **build and run Docker images** from within Codiad
    (e.g. using the Terminal plugin or Macros plugin). It also gives often nearly `root` access to your Codiad
    users so use it with care. If you see client API incompatible, you may try to mount also `-v /usr/bin/docker:/usr/bin/docker:ro`.
    Just ensure that user `CODIAD_UID:CODIAD_GID` has read access to that socket file.


### User / Group Identifiers

TL;DR - The `CODIAD_UID` and `CODIAD_UID` values set the user / group you'd like your container to 'run as'. This can be a user you've created or even root (not recommended).

Part of what makes our containers work so well is by allowing you to specify your own PUID and PGID. This avoids nasty permissions errors with relation to data volumes (-v flags). When an application is installed on the host OS it is normally added to the common group called users, Docker apps due to the nature of the technology can't be added to this group. So we added this feature to let you easily choose when running your containers.


### Setting up your projects

  * Store your projects somewhere below `/code/`, for data persistence (or mount another volume).
  * Install common [plug-ins](http://market.codiad.com/) via the web interface, like:
      * [Collaboration](https://github.com/Codiad/Codiad-Collaborative)
      * [Terminal](https://github.com/Fluidbyte/Codiad-Terminal)
          * Change `/code/plugins/Codiad-Terminal-master/emulator/term.php` to change terminal password (default is `terminal`).
      * [CodeGit](https://github.com/Andr3as/Codiad-CodeGit)
          * Change `/code/plugins/Codiad-CodeGit-master/shell.sh` to add Git user/pass.
          * To set up SSH key (see also [Codiad Wiki](https://github.com/Andr3as/Codiad-CodeGit/wiki)) you can run using Codiad Terminal:

                ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
                ssh-keyscan -t rsa,dsa $DOMAIN_NAME >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
                cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
      * [Drag and Drop](https://github.com/Andr3as/Codiad-DragDrop)
      * [Emmet](https://github.com/Andr3as/Codiad-Emmet)
      * [Macro](https://github.com/daeks/Codiad-Macro)
      * ...
   * Check [Codiad Hot-Keys](https://github.com/Codiad/Codiad/wiki/Hot-Keys)


### Extending the capabilies

You can easily extend to include tool you may need and have them ready
whenever you re-create your container. Just create a `Dockerfile` like:

    FROM wernight/codiad
    RUN apt update && apt install -y build-essential python

Now you can just build and use your new image:

    $ docker build -t codiad .
    $ docker run --rm -p 8080:80 codiad


## Versions

  * **2016-06-29:** Makes `latest` based on Ubuntu due to some bugs and to allow extending; keep `alpine` as a branch.
  * **2016-06-24:** Base on Alpine + S6 + Nginx + PHP-FPM.
  * **2016-06-23:** Removed plug-ins and inlined this repos' init scripts.
